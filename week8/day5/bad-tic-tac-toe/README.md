## Bad Tic-Tac-Toe

A quick review of React showing how state and props can be used. 

Please note: this is not the full code, only the files I've changed. If you want this to work on your machine you'll need to run `npx create-react-app bad-tic-tac-toe` and change/create the files to contain this code.
